    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
 <p>Alma College’s mission is “to prepare graduates who think critically, serve generously, lead purposefully, and live responsibly as stewards of the world they bequeath to future generations.”</p>

 <h3>Course Description</h3>
 <p>Advanced data structures and algorithms, algorithmic analysis, and an introduction to distributed and parallel algorithms.</p>

 <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

 <p>At the successful completion of this course, you will:
   <ol>
     <li>
   </li></ol>



 <h3>Course Materials</h3>

 <p>The required textbook for this course is <i>Introduction to The Design and Analysis of Algorithms</i>, 3rd edition, by Anany Levitin.</p>

 <p>We will be using python at various points throughout the semester; I will generally expect you to learn enough python to get by, though we'll spend some time in class on some of the "algorithmically interesting" elements of python. I strongly encourage you to use <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html">Think Python</a>, 2nd ed.</p>

 <p>I also endorse the use of <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>; please sign up for a free account there to make it easy for us to share work and code. If you are inclined to install python on your personal machine&mdash;which I will ask you to do later in the semester&mdash;go all the way and install <a href="https://jupyter.org/">JupyterLab</a>, which is a pretty nifty environment for working with python.</p>


        <h3>Grading Policies</h3>

 <p>
   Your course grade will be calculated as follows:
   <pre>
     15%  "Daily" lecture quizzes
     15%  Homework (non-programming)
     30%  Programming assignments
     40%  Exams</pre>

   <h4>Quizzes</h4>
 <p>Most lecture meetings will being with a short multiple-choice quiz, either to check your comprehension of the assigned reading or to more generally assess the class's understanding of concepts. The reading-comprehension quizzes will happen about once per chapter and will be scored on a per-question basis; the assessment quizzes will be more frequent and will generally be graded as did- or didn't-participate. Thus, the reading comprehension quizzes will be a slightly more important element of your course grade, but these are intended to be "low-stakes" quizzes that mostly useful for all of us to see how individuals and the entire class is doing.</p>

 <h4>Homework</h4>
 <p>I will occasionally assign some non-programming problems (e.g. relating to analysis of an algorithm's efficiency). These will be graded on a check/check-plus/check-minus basis.</p>

 <h4>Programming assignments</h4>
 <p>Over the course of the semester, you will turn in a few more substantial assignments that ask you to write a program to solve a problem. These will be carefully graded in accordance with a rubric I will share with you as part of the assignment.</p>

 <h4>Exams</h4>
 <p>Exams are an opportunity for you to gather and review the material covered to date in the course. If you've been keeping up with the course, the exams will not pose a big challenge. But, the exams are also a way for me to make sure that you've begun to master the material (and aren't just relying on friends or the internet). We'll discuss during the first class meeting how the three scheduled exams should be weighted.</p>
<hr style="width:25%"/>

 <p>
   Because this is a fast-paced, demanding course, I will generally not allow late submission of assignments. If you have a medical/family emergency that causes you to miss class, talk to me about it ASAP. If you find that events in your life are making it difficult for you to complete work for this class in timely fashion, please talk to me (again) <em>as soon as possible</em> so that we can discuss how to get you through the class. Note that while attendance is not an <strong>explicit</strong> element of your course grade, almost every class meeting will include an activity (such as a quiz) that impacts your grade.
 </p>

 <p>  I will determine your final grade with a rough "curve." Almost always, I set the lowest "AB" grade to be the mean score in the class. So if you are above the average, you will earn a B or A; if you are below the average you will earn a C or lower. You can use this as a rough guide to translate your scores on exams and assignments into letter grades. However, if the mean score is 80 or above, I will grade on a "straight scale" in which scores in the 80s earn Bs and scores in the 90s earn As. That is, my curve is designed to "protect" you from any especially rigorous grading.</p>




<h3>Other Course Policies</h3>

<h4>Communication and Device Usage</h4> <p>Coming to my office hours is the best way to get my undivided attention. When you can't make it to office hours to ask a question, message me through Moodle. (While you should certainly check your Alma College email address frequently, I will aim to keep all course-related electronic communication on Moodle.) If you message me after 5pm or on the weekend, I may not respond until the next weekday.</p>

<p>Our course content obviously lends itself to the classroom use of laptops, tablets, and phones; I expect to make use of Moodle during class as well. However, I expect you to demonstrate your respect for yourself and others by limiting your use of these devices to classroom-relevant activities. In particular, use of email, social media, or the general web is not acceptable unless I specifically ask you to. I reserve the right to erase one or more daily quiz scores because of inappropriate device usage.</p>


<h4>Final Exam</h4>
 <p>Below is the final exam policy from  page 53 of the MOE:</p>
<p>4. Examinations:</br>
a. Course examinations and quizzes are to be given during the regular class period as specified in the syllabus. Instructors should not give a unit exam during the last week of classes if they have scheduled a final exam during exam week.</br>
  b. Final examination week is included in the calculation of credit hours required by the College’s accreditor. Therefore, exams must be administered during the designated time period of each final exam week. Early final examinations are not permitted. If the course does not require a final exam, a class meeting must be scheduled during the designated period or another assignment requiring no less than 2.5 hours of student work per course credit must be scheduled.</p>


<h4>Email</h4> <p>Students are expected to read their Alma College email on a daily basis. Important (and time-sensitive) messages about this class and other campus updates could be sent at any time, and email is one of the most common channels for sharing that information. I may not respond to emails sent after 5pm or on the weekend until the next business day.</p>

<h4>Academic Integrity</h4> In view of the college’s commitment to ethical integrity, it must take strong exception to behavior which is untruthful. Academic dishonesty includes the following:
<ul>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>Exchange of information on examinations</li>
  <li>Assistance in the completion of an exam, writing of essays or laboratory reports</li>
  <li>Computer software theft</li>
  <li>In particular, if I determine that part or all of a student's coding assignment submission has been copied from another student, <em>all</em> students involved will get a <b>zero</b> on the assignment. You are responsible for safeguarding your work.</li>
</ul>

 <p>Disciplinary action following dishonesty is handled by the faculty member. It may result in failure of the course involved. All infractions and actions will be reported to and recorded in the Provost’s Office. Repeated evidence of academic dishonesty is reviewed by the Provost and may involve more severe penalties.</p>

 <p>In general, I will encourage collaboration during class, but I also expect you to demonstrate your ability to work effectively on your own. If you have questions about my policies and/or the <a href="https://www.alma.edu/student-handbook/section-ii/academic-dishonesty-policy/">College's policies</a>, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

 <h4>Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</h4>
 <p>I am  committed to creating an inclusive classroom that respects a wide range of experiences, viewpoints, and abilities. Please don't hesitate to talk with me or the Center for Student Opportunity (see below) if there is anything I can do to increase your opportunities for learning in our classroom.</p>
